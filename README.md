#THE ULTIMATE GET STARTED GUIDE


The Code Rep Collective is here to help propel a more equitable world! With so many people in the world unforunately many suffer, which means each group has specific needs. So in this moment we choose to rectify a right that the United States of America and Canada haven't properly done! As a community we choose to give the Black citizens of America an oppurtunity through tech education to 'level up' despite being "kneeled on" constantly throughout Americas 400 year old history. 

Our stand and actions reflect a specfic mission to create equity for Black Americans: 

#BLACK LIVES MATTER

#Black Education Matters

#Black Prosperity Matters

This group was started as a direct response to the protest happening across the United States and eventually the rest of the world. These rotests are not results of the murder of #George Floyd, but are results of long term systematic oppression, this oppression was not corrected by the United States over the last 155 years after the abolition of slavery. Former slaves where offered 40 acres and a mule but instead were plagued by a new form of oppression known as Jim Crow. Since Jim Crow there has been a lot of back handed and racist policies that have continued to create stumbling blocks for black citize. These polcies often pit minority groups against each other, and created over policing, prison industrial complex, food deserts, and more.

Resulting the stratgic placement of Black Americans at the bottom of this caste system. Causing our focus to be laser sharp, it is common for black people to get clumped with in with other minority groups and not get their needs met, worse yet ignored. This group is a direct way to make sure this group serves those people. A second part is there is a complex psychological/mental toll that is different from other communities due to the dichotomy of not belonging in your own country and not having a country of direct descedents, we fill this plight will inform the way we will work to bridge the knowledge gap.

To sum it all up special needs to meet a specific groups needs. Not allowing erasure of the Black plight of slavery descendants. A shared cultural understanding to better serve this specific community.
